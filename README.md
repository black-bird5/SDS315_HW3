# SDS315_HW3

Located in this repository is my RMD file with all the code for HW3 of SDS315. All the CSVs needed to reproduce my results are located here as well. To reproduce my results, download SDS315_HW3.RMD and all the CSVs and put them all in the same working directory. From there, just run the RMD file. Necessary packages are listed at the top of the RMD file. This should reproduce my HW3 results.
